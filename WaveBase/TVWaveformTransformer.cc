// TVWaveformTransformer
// 
// Abstract class handling transformations, processing of waveforms.  It
// handles the different cases for in-place and out-of-place transformations
// efficiently.
//
// To derive from this class:
//
// User must define IsInPlace(). Return true and overload TransformInPlace() if
// the derived class is most effectively coded as an in-place transformation.
// Otherwise return false and overload TransformOutOfPlace(). If a class has
// efficient versions for both in-place and out-of-place transformations,
// overload IsInPlace() and IsOutOfPlace() to both return true, and implement
// the versions in the respective TransformIn/OutOfPlace() function.  For the
// latter, the most efficient is to implement a function that contains the same
// algorithm and have both TransformInPlace and TransformOutOfPlace call this
// function. 

void TVWaveformTransformer::Transform(TDoubleWaveform* input, TDoubleWaveform* output) const

  // TransformWaveform must be defined by derived classes.  This function takes
  // an input waveform and performs some type of transformation on it.  The output is set
  // to NULL by default meaning the result of the transformation is stored in the input
  // waveform.  Otherwise the transformation is stored in the output waveform.


  // The user requests an in-place or out-of-place transform by either
  // supplying a NULL output (for in-place) or a valid output pointer (for
  // out-of-place). We want to call the appropriate function in the derived
  // class that performs the transformation in the optimal way. Do this in
  // the base class so that the derived classes don't need to.

  // If an output waveform was given, then clearly the user wants an out-of-place transform.
  // In case the appropriate function is not defined in the derived class, the base versions
  // will do the right thing.
